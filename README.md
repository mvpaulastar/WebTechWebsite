# Website
This is a website I am working on for a class, hosted over AWS.
I am using the free t2.micro as my instance type as it is available for AWS free tier.
All work done on the website for this class is being recorded in a repository for later studying and use.

Each folder is a different iteration of the website.

Folders for hw2-5 are all pure html whereas folders hw6 and beyond introduce CSS, Bootstrap 5.2.3, and later javascript.
The idea for this repository is to document the growth of a website as more and more techniques to web development are added.
